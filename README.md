# PYTHON-ML---Healthcare-Diagnosis-Using-AI---Cardiovascular-Disease

**Project Summary: Healthcare Diagnosis Using AI â€“ Cardiovascular Disease Use Case**

**Overview:** The "Healthcare Diagnosis Using AI" project focuses on developing a classification model to diagnose cardiovascular disease (CVD) based on various health-related experimental data and medical history. Early and accurate diagnosis of CVD is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. The project aims to address the challenges in accurately diagnosing CVD, which can be complex due to the disease's variability of symptoms.

**Business Problem:** Misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of cardiovascular disease can lead to serious consequences for patients, including higher healthcare costs, decreased patient satisfaction, and poorer patient outcomes. This project aims to mitigate these issues by leveraging AI and machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of CVD diagnosis.

**Key Statistics:** Cardiovascular disease accounts for 32% of global deaths in 2019.

**Approach:** This python project follows a data-driven approach to extract meaningful insights from raw data and build a heart disease classification model. The key steps include:
1.	Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the raw data.
2.	Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features for classification.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing and analyzing correlations among different features.
4.	Model Implementation: Implementing logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models for classification.
5.	Assessing Model Performance: Comparing the performance of different models based on testing accuracy,F1 score, precision, recall and confusion matrix.

**Results:** Among the implemented models, 
Logistic regression achieved the highest testing accuracy of 82.4% and highest F1 score.
Decision tree had a testing accuracy of 75.8%, which is lower than both logistic regression and random forest, and may also be overfitting the training data.
Random forest achieved the highest training accuracy of 94.8% but had a lower testing accuracy of 76.9% compared to logistic regression, which suggests that it may be overfitting the training data.

**Business Takeaways:** The project highlights several potential benefits of leveraging AI for healthcare diagnosis, including accurate diagnosis, improved patient outcomes, cost savings, reduced healthcare resource costs, and improved patient satisfaction. However, there are limitations and future scope for scaling the model and further research and development.
